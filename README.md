PROBLEM  STATEMENT : 
These days containerization techniques are quite famous in industries and companies, but most of us are not aware how to use it as it requires certain set of commands to perform a task which cannot be easily understood by a person so we have created a website Kubernetes App which makes it easier to interact with the user.
Talking about Kubernetes, it is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.
This website will only take the required name as input and all the commands will run in backend, so there is no requirement to write the whole command, also there is a window which will allow the user to write its own commands (Linux based commands) who is apprised to it.

REQUIREMENTS :
Hard-ware requirements: 
8GB RAM CPU
Windows 10 
CORE i3 Gen 7th

Soft-ware requirements: 
Virtual Box
Python-cgi installed in the OS(Virtual BOX)
Minikube
Any Browser


TECHNOLOGIES USED : Kubernetes, Docker, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS



PROJECT DESCRIPTION : 
Making a Web-UI interface which is user friendly as it is really difficult to learn all Linux based commands including the commands used in minikube so we have created this web-UI so that the user does not have to go through all the commands and learn them, he just have to open the website and work on Kubernetes, rest all is running in the background with the help of Python-cgi server which hosts a website in back-end and perform the tasks, in front-end we have used JS, HTML and CSS and added the features like launching pods, creating deployment, services and much more.
There is also a window where the user can write the commands if he uses Linux and have information about certain set of commands.
We have also added our GitHub and LinkedIn profiles in the website.
 It can launch pods with the specific names given by users.
 Run deployment using the image and name given by the user.
 Expose services on given user input port number.
 Scale the replica according to user needs.
 Delete complete environment created.
 Delete specific resources given by the user.
 Extra features related to k8s (Optional)



SCOPE :
User-friendly
Automated
Solves time complexity
Improves Efficiency
Easy to operate
Interactive Web-UI

CHALLENGES FACED :
It was a challenge for us to use minikube on linux terminal so we changed the IP configuration and connected them with each other with the help of files and folders.

CONCLUSION :
While using minikube we thought that it is difficult and time consuming to write all the commands time and again so to make it easier we thought of making this website.
